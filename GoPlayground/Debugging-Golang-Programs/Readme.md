##### Debugging Go Programs Using Delve
1. In terminal fire: `go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv` or [If in case 1st command doesn't works] `go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv`
2. To open delve `dlv debug Producer-Consumer-Generic-Configurable-Approach.go`
3. To set break point. Mention your file name with line number: `break your-program-file-name:19`
4. Then to proceed further fire in delve prompt itself `continue`
5. To list function arguments. Fire up `args`
6. To print local variables `locals`.
7. To jump to next line `next`.

$ dlv help
Delve is a source level debugger for Go programs.

Delve enables you to interact with your program by controlling the execution of the process,
evaluating variables, and providing information of thread / goroutine state, CPU register state and more.

The goal of this tool is to provide a simple yet powerful interface for debugging Go programs.

Pass flags to the program you are debugging using `--`, for example:

`dlv exec ./hello -- server --config conf/config.toml`

Usage:
  dlv [command]

Available Commands:
  attach      Attach to running process and begin debugging.
  connect     Connect to a headless debug server with a terminal client.
  core        Examine a core dump.
  dap         Starts a headless TCP server communicating via Debug Adaptor Protocol (DAP).
  debug       Compile and begin debugging main package in current directory, or the package specified.
  exec        Execute a precompiled binary, and begin a debug session.
  help        Help about any command
  run         Deprecated command. Use 'debug' instead.
  test        Compile test binary and begin debugging program.
  trace       Compile and begin tracing program.
  version     Prints version.

Flags:
      --accept-multiclient               Allows a headless server to accept multiple client connections via JSON-RPC or DAP.
      --allow-non-terminal-interactive   Allows interactive sessions of Delve that don't have a terminal as stdin, stdout and stderr
      --api-version int                  Selects JSON-RPC API version when headless. New clients should use v2. Can be reset via RPCServer.SetApiVersion. See Documentation/api/json-rpc/README.md. (default 1)
      --backend string                   Backend selection (see 'dlv help backend'). (default "default")
      --build-flags string               Build flags, to be passed to the compiler. For example: --build-flags="-tags=integration -mod=vendor -cover -v"
      --check-go-version                 Exits if the version of Go in use is not compatible (too old or too new) with the version of Delve. (default true)
      --disable-aslr                     Disables address space randomization
      --headless                         Run debug server only, in headless mode. Server will accept both JSON-RPC or DAP client connections.
  -h, --help                             help for dlv
      --init string                      Init file, executed by the terminal client.
  -l, --listen string                    Debugging server listen address. (default "127.0.0.1:0")
      --log                              Enable debugging server logging.
      --log-dest string                  Writes logs to the specified file or file descriptor (see 'dlv help log').
      --log-output string                Comma separated list of components that should produce debug output (see 'dlv help log')
      --only-same-user                   Only connections from the same user that started this instance of Delve are allowed to connect. (default true)
  -r, --redirect stringArray             Specifies redirect rules for target process (see 'dlv help redirect')
      --wd string                        Working directory for running the program.

Additional help topics:
  dlv backend  Help about the --backend flag.
  dlv log      Help about logging flags.
  dlv redirect Help about file redirection.

Use "dlv [command] --help" for more information about a command.
